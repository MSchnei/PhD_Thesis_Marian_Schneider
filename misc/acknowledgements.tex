\chapter{Acknowledgments}
- Federico. I know you always read this section of the thesis with your utmost attention. So be assured that these lines have been chosen very carefully for you. The best closer in town. Some humans attempt to separate their private and their professional lives. Not you. As your supervisee, one always gets the full Federico, one unique piece of a human. May the cores of your computer always be busy.
- Rainer
- Nikolaus
- Ingo and Faruk, my brothers in arms. When I was deciding where to do the PhD, there were many aspects that I considered. One thing that I totally underestimated when making this decision is the influence of peers. As the ancient German proverb has it "even a blind chicken sometimes finds a grain to pick" - indicating that even undeserving people sometimes get lucky. I guess in this case the chicken (me) was not only blind but also headless and got more than lucky. I am tremendously indebted to you. May your thirst for exploration never die and your fountain of knowledge continue flowing.
- Mario, my most competent friend and breaker of the chain of causation that keeps your free will unfree. I am not being ironic here. Or am I? I guess it doesn't matter as long as it is "just" a problem of your mind. May you and your external supervisor be happy ever after.
- Yawen, Geraldine and Linda
- Franc and Sri, my companions.
- Senior generation of PhD students (Valentin, Thomas, Mario and Arko) the honorable gentlemen.
- The Dutch people and state, for providing near-utopic conditions for living and doing research. May your model of the welfare state outlast right-wing populists.
- The European Union, for giving its citizens the freedom of movement.
- Meine Familie, Claudia, Norbert und Sarah.
- Undine
