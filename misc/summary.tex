\chapter{Summary}
Existing knowledge of how cortical responses link to conscious content in humans is either inferred from animal models or from human studies limited by lower spatial resolution. While previous studies could relate distinct categorical percepts (faces vs. places) to signal differences across brain areas, measuring responses at sub-millimeter resolution allowed us to link sub-category conscious percepts (vertical vs. horizontal motion) to amplitude changes of separate populations within the same brain area. Furthermore, preferences for horizontal and vertical motion were organized into columnar clusters. We pave the way for future studies investigating if columnar clusters represent sub-categorical distinctions in conscious content different from motion or in high-level perceptual and cognitive phenomena.
